ValueError: In models with integration (`d > 0`) or seasonal integration (`D > 0`), trend terms of lower order than `d + D` cannot be (as they would be eliminated due to the differencing operation). For example, a constant cannot be included in an ARIMA(1, 1, 1) model, but including a linear trend, which would have the same effect as fitting a constant to the differenced data, is allowed.
